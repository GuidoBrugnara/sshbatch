SSH::Batch

DESCRIPTION

This is a Perl module for cluster operations based on Net::OpenSSH.

The following scripts are provided:

* fornodes

  Expand patterns to machine host list.

    $ cat > ~/.fornodesrc
    ps=blah.ps.com bloo.ps.com boo[2-25,26-70].ps.com
    as=ws[1101-1105].as.com
    ^D
    $ fornodes 'api[02-10].foo.bar.com' 'boo*.ps.com'
    $ fornodes 'tq[ab-ac].[1101-1105].foo.com'
    $ fornodes '{ps} + {as} - ws1104.as.com'  # set union and subtraction
    $ fornodes '{ps} * {as}'  # set intersect

* atnodes (TODO)

  Run command on clusters.

    # atnodes calls fornodes internally:
    $ atnodes $'ps -fe|grep httpd' 'ws[1101-1105].as.com'

* tonodes (TODO)

  Transfer local files or directories to clusters.

    $ tonodes /tmp/*.inst -- '{as}:/tmp/'
    $ tonodes /tmp/*.inst -- 'ws1105*:/tmp/'
